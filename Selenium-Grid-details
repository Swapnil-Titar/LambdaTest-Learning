1.Selemium Hub can be startd from: 
 java -jar selenium-sever-standalone-<version>.jar -role hub
 
2.Hub generally runs on port 4444 as default. if we want to change the port we need to do this as :  
 -host <IP|Host> -port <port_number>

For access the hub - https://localhost:4444/grid/console or if we have host then we need to use its IP
https://IP:4444/grid/console

Nodes: we need to run from same location where our stanalone server jar is placed
java -jar selenium-sever-standalone-<version>.jar -role node -hub https://localhost:4444/grid/register

if we want to change the browsers and windows / os configurations use them as follows:
-browser browserName=firefox, version=4, maxInstaces=4, platform=WINDOWS
